<h2>In case you're wondering what I'm up to right <b>now</b></h2>

      <h2>I'm living that Londoner life</h2>
        <p>Since moving here in December 2018 I'm living that Londoner life. I'm not sure where life will take me next time and how long we (as in me and my partner) are going to stay in here, but so far it's all good!</p>

   <h2>Working full-time as UX designer</h2>
   <p>At the same time I moved to London - I started full-time job as UX Designer in a startup here. I'm doing my best to deliver something good and I witnessed going live, starting from 0 to 65k users. It's great to be a part of something this cool.</p>

<h2>Podcasting my voice out there</h2>
<p>I'm still doing my podcast. It feels great to vent all of that tech-rage or tech-happines once a week. Podcast is still growing so it's great to do something that still has potential!</p>

<h2>Culture-wise</h2>
<p>I'm not reading a lot nowadays because I picked up podcasts on my daily commute. Besides Reply All and Do By Friday I'm enjoying 13 Minutes to the Moon and Blackout. Give them a sub. They're worth it!</p>

<p>Thank you for being here. If you think we could do something cool - let me know. <a href="index.html">I'm happy to help.</a></p>
