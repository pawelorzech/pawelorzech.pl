      <h2>In case you're wondering what I'm up to right <b>now</b></h2>
      
      <h2>I'm living that Warsaw life</h2>
      <p>I moved back with my fiancee to Poland after 1,5 years in London. It was a great adventure and one that I'll never forget but I think I have found my place on Earth and it's Warsaw. There's no doubt in it! So now, after long time, I'm enjoying my stay here and I'm trying to get to know Warsaw much better than the last time.</p>
      
      <h2>Working full-time as Senior UX designer</h2>
      <p>At the same time I moved to Warsaw - I started full-time job as Senior UX Designer in a gamedev industry! I have joined 11 bits studio and let me tell ya - it's something so new and fresh that I can't even yet. I have this feeling though that it will be something really great and I can't wait to share more.</p>
      
      <h2>Podcasting my voice out there</h2>
      <p>I'm still doing my podcast. It feels great to talk about things that are currently on my mind. Podcast is still growing so it's great to do something that still has potential! We are going to do the YouTube thing too, so it looks like my next big thing!</p>
      
      <h2>Culture-wise</h2>
      <p>I'm not reading a lot nowadays because I picked up podcasts on my daily commute. Besides Reply All, Do By Friday and Cortex, I'm trying to get myself into productivity and meta-productivity podcasts about being self-employed and about side business. I have this itch that I want to scratch and I guess that's it.</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for being here. If you think we could do something cool - let me know. <a href="index.html">I'm happy to help.</a></p>
